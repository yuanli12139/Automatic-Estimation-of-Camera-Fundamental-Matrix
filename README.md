# Automatic-Estimation-of-Camera-Fundamental-Matrix
• Implemented corner detection and used normalized correlation coefficient for feature extraction and matching with stereo images. Implemented the 7-point algorithm with Sampson Error Correction in MSAC for outlier rejection. Implemented the 8-point algorithm in Direct Linear Transformation to estimate the camera’s Fundamental matrix. Implemented Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm to minimize the reprojection error with Triangulation and Optimal Correction.
